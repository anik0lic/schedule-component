# Schedule Management Library
Java Library developed for University for managing schedule data with two distinct implementations offering adaptability to diverse use cases. The library is designed with API specification that outlines all operations that can be used.

## **First implementation** 
Presents a schedule as a collection of appointments, allowing users to efficiently organize and manage individual events. This approach offers granularity at the appointment level, enabling precise scheduling and tracking.

## **Second implementation** 
Presents schedule on a weekly basis for specified periods. This design is particularly useful for handling broader timeframes, making it ideal for planning academic terms, semester-long activities, or any recurring events that follow a weekly pattern.

## **Test Application**
Small JavaFX test application is made to present library's capabilities. This interactive application provides a visual representation of the library's functionalities.
